  <h2>My imaginative creature is a kind of worm that form its body by taking the petal of flowers. When the mouse is clicked, the creatures will come out, with their bodies’ color and size of the circle components the same as the flowers that “bear” them. When restarted, the colors, size, and position of the flowers will change, and those parameters of the worms will change accordingly. The worms have three kinds of moving forms: rotating, linear moving, moving according to the mouse position. To make the worms move in a lively way, the legs are consistently rotating, and each shoes’ rotation is slightly different from the beside legs.</p>
